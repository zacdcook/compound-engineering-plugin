# Compounding Engineering Plugin Development

## Versioning Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Every change to this plugin MUST include updates to all three files:

1. **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** - Bump version using semver
2. **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Document changes using Keep a Changelog format
3. **`README.md`** - Verify/update component counts and tables

### Version Bumping Rules

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes, major reorganization
- **MINOR** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New agents, commands, or skills
- **PATCH** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes, doc updates, minor improvements

### Pre-Commit Checklist

- [ ] README.md component counts verified
- [ ] README.md tables accurate (agents, commands, skills)
