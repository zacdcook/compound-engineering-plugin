All notable changes to the compounding-engineering plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.6.0] - 2024-11-26

### Removed

- **`feedback-codifier` agent** - Removed from workflow agents. Agent count reduced from 24 to 23.

## [2.5.0] - 2024-11-25

### Added

- **`/report-bug` command** - New slash command for reporting bugs in the compounding-engineering plugin. Provides a structured workflow that gathers bug information through guided questions, collects environment details automatically, and creates a GitHub issue in the EveryInc/every-marketplace repository. Designed to be user-friendly for anyone using the plugin.

## [2.4.1] - 2024-11-24

### Improved

- **design-iterator agent** - Added focused screenshot guidance: always capture only the target element/area instead of full page screenshots. Includes browser_resize recommendations, element-targeted screenshot workflow using browser_snapshot refs, and explicit instruction to never use fullPage mode. Also added step to load relevant design skills (e.g., Swiss design) before starting iterations.

## [2.4.0] - 2024-11-24

### Fixed

- **MCP Configuration** - Moved MCP servers back to `plugin.json` following working examples from anthropics/life-sciences plugins. Removed `.mcp.json` file as it's not the correct approach.
- **Context7 URL** - Updated to use HTTP type with correct endpoint URL.

## [2.3.0] - 2024-11-24

### Changed

- **MCP Configuration** - Moved MCP servers from inline `plugin.json` to separate `.mcp.json` file per Claude Code best practices for plugin MCP integration.

## [2.2.1] - 2024-11-24

### Fixed

- **Playwright MCP Server** - Added missing `"type": "stdio"` field required for MCP server configuration to load properly.

## [2.2.0] - 2024-11-24

### Added

- **Context7 MCP Server** - Bundled Context7 for instant framework documentation lookup. Provides up-to-date docs for Rails, React, Next.js, and 100+ other frameworks.

## [2.1.0] - 2024-11-24

### Added

- **Playwright MCP Server** - Bundled `@playwright/mcp` for browser automation across all projects using this plugin. Provides screenshot, navigation, click, fill, and evaluate tools.

### Changed

- Replaced all Puppeteer references with Playwright across agents and commands:
  - `bug-reproduction-validator` agent
  - `design-iterator` agent
  - `design-implementation-reviewer` agent
  - `figma-design-sync` agent
  - `generate_command` command

## [2.0.2] - 2024-11-24

### Changed

- `design-iterator` agent - Updated description to emphasize proactive usage when design work isn't coming together on first attempt. Added examples showing how to suggest 5x or 10x iterations when initial changes don't fully resolve design issues.

## [2.0.1] - 2024-11-24

### Added

- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions with versioning requirements and pre-commit checklist
- `docs/solutions/plugin-versioning-requirements.md` - Detailed workflow documentation for maintaining version, CHANGELOG, and README in sync
